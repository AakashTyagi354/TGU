    title: "REFLECTIVE GLASS",
    desc: "REFLECTIVE GLASS Reflective glass is annealed or standard glass that has a thin layer of metallic or metallic oxide coating. Since this coating is applied to only one side of the glass, it has a mirror like appearance. This reflective coating is applied during the float process to enhance the amount of heat reflected by the glass. It can absorb and reflect the sun’s harmful UV and infrared rays yet allow natural visible light to pass through. It also prevents excessive solar glare. However, it does allow natural light to pass through, offering optimal daylighting.",

    title: "Low-E glass",
    desc: "Low-E stands for low emissivity. Low-E windows contain glass that has been coated in invisible layers of metallic oxide. This coating allows natural light to enter the home while deflecting UV rays and infrared light back out into the environment. UV rays are invisible rays of light emitted by the sun. UV rays are responsible for fading upholstery, burning skin and, over the course of many years, damaging building materials. Infrared light is heat that warms your home during the winter. By deflecting both types of light back out into the environment, low-E coatings help keep your home warm in winter and cool in summer Low-E glass has a coating that reflects short and long-wave infrared rays. The only light that passes through low-E coatings is visible light",
    subTitle: "How Does It Work?",
    desc2:
      "In a way, low-E coatings sound almost too good to be true. How can glass enable light to enter or exit the home, while preventing heat loss in the winter and heat entry in the summer? Low-E coatings are not visible to the naked eye. However, they are still reflective, just like the silver coating on the inside of a thermos. This reduces the emissivity of the glass and prevents certain types of light from entering or exiting the home. Low-E coatings are selectively reflective, and only allow light of a certain wavelength and frequency to pass through glass",

      "Fire resistant glazing solutions from SGG that will not only keep people safe but will protect the building itself. In the event of fire, we face threats like hot gases, smoke and heat transmission. These threats put the safe evacuation of people and protection of property at risk. Our glass solutions are able to resist such threats and suit the requirements of a complete range of building applications – including aesthetically appealing system solutions for seamless architectural integration. Flat glass that has a seamed edge or slightly beveled edge is that which has been lightly sanded to remove any sharp burrs for. This glass is safe to handle but is not intended for decorative use. A sanding belt is used to lightly sand off the sharp edges of the glass also referred to as a swiped edge or a chamfered edge. Seamed edges are the most economical but not recommended if the edges will be exposed. Additionally ASTM C1036 standard specification for flat glass – edge chips are allowed on this form of edge work. Anti-glare glasses come with an anti-reflective (AR) coating, which is fine layer on the surface of the glasses and improves your vision, which in turn, helps reduce the amount of glare that reflects off your eye lens. Glare is responsible for certain eye-related issues such as low visibility in poor lighting, which can be dangerous if you are driving at night. Apart from that you may also experience seeing halos around bright lights and even cause headaches if your eyes are exposed to too much glare for an extended period of time, for example, while working in front of the computer. Acid-etching is a specialized glass fabrication process involving the application of hydrofluoric acid to annealed glass sheets or sections to give its surface a frosted look. It can also be used to create specialty designs, such as horizontal and vertical lines, and graphics. Because this process involves various chemical compounds, it's therefore best to consult an experienced fabricator boasting valued partnerships with acid-etched glass manufacturers. Boasting an easy-to-maintain, smooth finish, acid-etched glass can be cut to any size or shape prior to tempering. Its durability also withstands increased wear and tear. Double glazing refers to a window that has two panes of glass. The main component of the window is the double glazed sealed unit, also known as an insulated glass unit (IGU) which sits in a frame of uPVC, aluminium or timber. The IGU comprises of two sheets of glass separated by a spacer bar to create an air gap which is filled with an insulating gas. A bit like a sandwich of glass bread with a filling of air. The primary benefit of double glazing is thermal insulation – to retain heat in a room whilst stopping cold air entering from outside to make the room more energy-efficient. A glass floor is a stunning, dramatic addition to any interior space. Not only does our glass flooring offer aesthetic appeal, but it also allows for light to flow into the space below. The unique benefits of SkyFloor® glass flooring continue with its superior, rigorously tested framing system and its exceptional engineering support and design flexibility. With a beauty and simplicity that can’t be matched, Glass Flooring Systems’ interior SkyFloor® system is the perfect solution for any glass-flooring project. Colour laminated glass is very similar to clear laminated glass but with the addition of a coloured interlayer. These allow for a rich palette of colour permutation, ranging from subtle transparent and translucent colours to opaque. Our colour laminates are manufactured using float glass as standard although also available in specialist glasses including low iron (crystal clear) and a variety of body tints (blue, bronze and grey). The type and thickness of the glass will have an effect on the colour chosen. An ideal product for use in structural and decorative applications as the process allows for a wealth of possibilities for a wide range of applications including screens, partitions and cladding.",
